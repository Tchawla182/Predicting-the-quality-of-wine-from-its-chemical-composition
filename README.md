# Predicting the quality of red and white wine from their physiochemical features and using our models for business applications

Welcome to the wine quality prediction project! In this project, we aim to build a model that can predict the quality of wine based on its physiochemical features. The dataset used in this project is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information on various wines, including their acidity, pH, and alcohol content. Our model will use this information to classify the quality of the wine as either "low," "medium," or "high." We hope that this model will be useful for wine producers and consumers alike, as it can help to identify the qualities of a given wine and potentially improve wine production processes. I also tailored the resultant wine model to address two realistic practical business applications.
